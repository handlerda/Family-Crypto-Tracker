# Family Crypto App (Crypfam)

Cyprfam is a free tool that allows families to keep track of different cryptocurrency accounts. Each family is made up of users that can track their crypto accounts regardless of custodian. We even support cold storage wallets such as Trezor and Ledger. In addition, family members can specify what accounts are shared between members. This makes it very easy for parents, legal guardians, and even passionate kiddos to keep track of their crypto securely and easily.
